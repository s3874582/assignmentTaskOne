              I am lucky I found my passion for Information Technology, I would love to achieve the goal of finishing the bachelor of Information Technology at the RMIT university. Finding employment in a field that I am passionate about. I am not sure who quoted the saying; ‘if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life’ but it is true. It could be life changing to strive for employment in a field that is future focused, innovative and inclusive of all. To be creative in a field that is inclusive. Would be fantastic. I can be creative with technology. 
              So a little about myself; I love to read, I like studying and learning new information. I read mainly self help books as I am interested in bettering myself and changing my perspective in life. I have a preference for planning and budgeting, just being organised in general. I don’t have a pet. My nationality is Australian. I am really excited to present my assignment, Thank you for viewing my assignment. </i></p>

            <p><i>I am interested in Information Technology because I want a career in a field I am passionate about.  I want more from myself and finally I feel like I have direction. I am really passionate about Information Technology. I think the information technology can career can be really trans-formative. What I hope to gain from this course would be confidence and ability and have the knowledge about Information Technology. What I lack in knowledge I make up in passion, ambition and drive. I don’t have a lot of experience in Information Technology but I have been researching and studying in my spare time, I want technical experts to show me the correct methods. 
             The field that interests me is the software development side; I hope to gain employment in this field or working towards developing small projects that I can make. I would most of all like to show myself that I can do it. To pursue a career that has so many benefits, it would change so much, allow me to grow as a person, to trust who I am and become the person who I was meant to be hopefully.
             Information Technology effects so much of our lives, we are always connected always available and can commute to anywhere. Information Technology promotes communication. Social media is an example of the adaption of Information Technology to promote communication. These establishments promote social media as a activity designed to entertain people. Examples of social media would be Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube. The impacts of Information Technology has on my life apart from giving me direction with an online course opportunity, would be to be able to have a program such as LibreOffice to embrace technology to promote the ability to produce notes on technology platforms therefore communicating with others, storing data and creating content on technology</i></p>

There are different styles of learning styles. There are the activists learning style, the reflectors learning style, theorists learning style and the pragmatists learning style. Reflector learning style refers to the observation of tasks to learn by observation, by watching others to observing tasks to take in information before processing information. People who are of a reflective learning style like to analysis data, thinking deeply and preferring to watch first. The weaknesses of the reflector learning style would be that the learning style can be not matched to the learning style with more extroverted personality and learning styles being presented. The strengths of reflector learning style would include processing data and information, being receptive and learning from feedback from others, flourishing in a learning experience.</i></p>
            <h2>Harry Potter sorting Hat test results- Ravenclaw</h2>
            <p><i>“You definitely belong in Ravenclaw, but you have a kindness that sets you apart from most. While some Ravenclaws can be seen as slightly haughty or intimidating, your Hufflepuff side means you are more approachable, and therefore have an easier time making friends. Despite your softness, you find it easy to detach yourself from emotional situations and give objective viewpoints, making you the perfect person to go to for advice. Your slight compatibility with Gryffindor house hints at an underlying desire for adventure that may manifest itself in a love of travel or trying new things.”</i></p>
            <h1>How do personality tests evaluate how we interact with others in a team environment?</h1>
            <p><i>It is essential to learn more about yourself so that you can grow as a individual. Better understanding our identity allows for active participation in team environments and leadership opportunities. Realising the positive and negative aspects of ourselves, so that to express our positives aspects of our personality or work on our faults. People are unique with particular skills to express their abilities to acquire knowledge and work within a team environment. With introverts learning to be more extroverted and extroverts learning to listen more carefully to introverts within the team environment. Effective exchanges and presenting information is important in the workplace, or even in our lives and knowing your personality is advantageous to connect meaningfully with our roles or as our roles in the professional environment .</i></p>

          <section class="sectionSixProjectIdeas">
            <h1 id="projectIdeas">PROJECT IDEAS</h1>
            <h2>Overview-</h2>
            <p><i>Overview for the Project idea would be a basic and modular operating system based on a web browser interface. The project that I will make would be the project name of Melon splice an open source operating system based on the Midori web browser, so a web based operating system that links in the browser Midori, therefore the name is suggestive of the cocktail Midori splice with the Midori connection.  Redefining the term operating system. A small but effective operating system with a web interface for user input. The project would be a small operating system based on a web browser. Why would I want to make an operating system. It  is the hardest project I could think of to achieve within a time frame. I wish to experiment with my resources and overcome my reasonable programming skill to produce an operating system that was simplistic  based on operating systems that worked with internet browser like the Linux based Chrome OS designed by google which uses a web browser as its principle user interface however I will make the project with Midori web browser, but more modular and effective this makes the project different.  I will not be making the web browser at this time. I think the more streamlined and simplistic the project  the better the overall project that I will produce. My style of coding or learning in general is to simplify and make more modular. This is what I wish to do with my project idea.</i></p>
            <h2> Motivation-</h2>
            <p><i>My motivation for making an operating system was to use  innovation and creativity to make a project for a web browser which is not as popular as browser such as chrome, with the chrome os. This would not be a new invention however I will build the skill necessary to build an operating system. As my motivation was to challenge myself to learn rapidly. To produce a project at the end of the allocated time frame. This project will be useful and interesting because I want to refine the operating system. An industrious little operating system that just works. When reformatting my computer I was stuck by the idea of simplifying the operating system. This could be for use in the future with the internet of things, with the operating system being so modular and effective. It would be great to have an operating system that was cooperative. This project would be an incentive to learn about information technology, the hardware to the software. Making my understanding of rudimentary reformatting procedure and hard disk partitioning a more efficient process as to understand completely the theory of the computer or technology as whole, what is an operating system how does it work with the hardware to determine a complementary result.</i></p>
            <h2> Description-</h2>
            <p><i>The Project idea would be a basic and modular operating system based on a web browser interface. My project will be unique because I am going to implement the operating system on a smaller scale simplifying the process therefore making the project more modular. The user can interact with the base operating system by interacting with the web browser. This would work similar to the input function as  the input is addressed by the operating system. I want to achieve the impossible to make an operating system. To make a small operating system based at this point on the web browser Midori. To make a small foundation, the less features the better, hopefully to implement a text editor and a web browser interface for the more services that the project runs the more memory the project will take on the hard-disk. I want the operating system to be rudimentary and yet effective so therefore fast, reliable. The features of the operating system would be to make the project as small simple system as possible. To make the project with the least amount of resources and least amount of features of the operating system. To control the hardware component of the operating system, the partitioning of the hard-disk with the project to be modular. To make the project hopefully to fit on a cd or maybe a usb stick for a complete foundation of an operating system. To take less resources and less space on the hardware I would like to keep resource reliance or dependence to a minium. I think the more streamlined, the more simplistic the project will be and therefore the better the overall project that I will produce because I want to produce the project in actuality.  Making a more streamlined, modular and effective product. Therefore a more reliable product. I am frustrated with the operating systems on the market as they are so complex and resource reliant. They take up so much space on the hard-disk,don’t have the accurate firmware available or the firmware is just a patch made by another large company. The products are incomplete and too immense as a project. The projects are made by large teams, with each programmer having their own style, patching the end result together. I am not part of a huge team like Microsoft or even Linux. I just want a basic operating system. I want to make the impossible. I want to do the impossible. To search for more, to create more. Who would need to use my operating system, who would therefore be the target market? The target market for the operating system would be anybody who wanted to be innovative with technology, to experiment with different technologies to see if we can answer the question of; Can we do better? Is there a more reliable and efficient way of determining what is an operating system. This project will be challenging and take allocated time however rewarding. With imagination and determination this idea can be implemented effectively. To make the impossible to possible.</i></p>
            <h2>Tools and Technologies-</h2>
            <p><i>The technologies needed for this project, the technical components that are required are a computer. However rudimentary I need a computer to test and run the scripts to make the operating system . I don’t have a reliable computer so I will  make do with no-brand technology. Tools that would be effective would be would be software that could be tested for reliability against the performance benchmarks that would be required to be completed for the minimal viable product to be achieved. Also the internet so that I can research, implement and test the reliability of the web browser that I will be implementing. The quality and the reliability if the product would need to tested, as to implement, develop, test and create the product, to achieve the goal of making an operating system with a web browser component.</i></p>
            <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p><i>The project of a small operating system based on a user interface with web technology would be an ambitious project which will need methodical planning and much research on resource management. As to achieve the best results possible from the project I will need to build up my skills in programming, my understanding of information technology needs work. The skills needed for this project would be knowledge of the programming languages to produce a minimum viable product . I wish to start small to determine the language I will use such as will it be feasible to make with the language C++ but this will be too advanced for my skill set. C++ just is so structured but it is complex. Operating systems like Microsoft Windows or the Linux kernel were developed using C++, however I intended to make a smaller operating system with a web based interface fro the user of the software.  At this point I do not require to make the web browser interface myself. A scripting language that I can be creative with should be effective. This should be adequate resources for the project. It is an ambitious undertaking however I think I can achieve this software project.</i></p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p><i>When the project is successful the outcome of the technology of an operating system that is small and effective would be that of a  simplified operating system  available on the market. That was not just a large corporation advertising and marketing the products that they sell that monitor our movements, record our  development, investigating and collecting our personal data. What can be achieved by the individual if these companies produce such monumental and cumbersome products. Are them products on the market the best products available or are we as consumers being effectively marketed to. The obstacles that I would face would be the programming skill that is rudimentary. I hope to make the project with scripting language, I have made scripts before to install programs on Linux operating system however I need to up-skill to leap before I look to create the impossible and to take on more than I can chew. This is swimming in the deep end of the pool. The development of a modular operating system would be that a fun project idea, I will find the project interesting. I will be making the web based interface operating system to learn, to acquire knowledge about information technology</i></p>
